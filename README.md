# Hi there! :wave: I'm Richard

I'm a full stack software engineer that specializes in React, Redux, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. I also have experience in HTML, CSS, Node.js and Express.js.

With a background in wholesale insurance, I have experience in prioritizing competing tasks under pressure, communicating clearly with clients and collaborating with other team members.

If I'm not in front of the computer coding, I'm likely watching my favorite shows, playing the bass guitar or cooking some homemade comfort food.👨‍🍳
